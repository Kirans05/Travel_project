          Please note that we are not responsible for remitting tax to relevant
          tax bodies as hotel suppliers will invoice pipertravels for tax amount
          and hotel suppliers will hand over taxes applicable to relevant
          bodies.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Areas and locations have their different tax rates and in paying tax
          amounts, there could be slight differences from tax recovery amount
          based on taxability and rates. Hotels may attract different service
          fees based on hotel type and amount. You should be able to confirm
          reservation changes where you fail to turn up, and must do so in not
          more than 24hrs or face the risk of having your reservation cancelled,
          as there are various cancellation policy periods for different hotels.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Where you choose to cancel or alter your prepaid hotel reservation,
          you might be charged for such changes subject to the rules of the
          hotels for such changes and agree to pay for such changes as may
          occur. Once your hotel reservation request (s) have been lodged, you
          authorize pipertravels to make hotel reservations on your behalf based
          on the room rates displayed on the website and on the availability of
          reservations, which will include payment arrangements, services fees,
          tax recovery charges. You are mandated to make back payments for early
          checkouts or no shows within days after checking out.
