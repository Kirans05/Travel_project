          both online and offline. Wherever we collect sensitive information
          (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and
          transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for
          a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for

          We keep your personal information for as long as is reasonably
          necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. For example, to
          manage bookings and provide you with any relevant products or
          services, as explained in this Privacy Notice. We will ensure that it
          is disposed of in a secure manner. In most cases we will destroy your
          data 7 years after collection in order to comply with UK HMRC rules.
          Where no booking is made, data will be removed not more than 12 months
          after collection<br></br>
          <br></br>
          In some circumstances we may store your personal information for
          longer periods of time, for example, where we are required to do so in
          accordance with legal, regulatory, tax, or accounting requirements. In
          specific circumstances we may store your personal information for
          longer periods of time so that we have an accurate record of your
          dealings with us in the event of any complaints or if we reasonably
          believe there is a prospect of litigation relating to your personal
          information or dealings.

          Using the pipertravels SIM card, mobile phone and tablet Apps (the "Mobile
          Apps")
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="subtitle" gutterBottom>
          When you use a pipertravels SIM Card or Mobile App, we collect and use
          information about you in the same way and for the same purposes as we
          do when you use our website.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          In addition to this, we also use some other information that we
          collect automatically when you use our Mobile Apps e.g. we collect
          information about Mobile App functionality that you access and use.
          This allows us to identify those areas of the Mobile App that are of
          interest to our customers so that we can refine and continuously
          improve the Mobile App. The information we collect for this purpose
          does not enable us to directly identify you.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          When you use our Mobile App, you can choose to allow access to your
          current location – provided by your mobile device using GPS or similar
          technologies – in order to identify nearby hotels or airports. If you
          choose to allow access, this location data may be collected
          anonymously as part of search requests logged by our servers. You can
          switch off the Mobile App’s access to your location at any time
          through your phone settings menu.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Each Mobile App will also send us error-reporting information in the
          event that it crashes or hangs. This enables us to investigate the
          error and to improve the stability of the Mobile App for future
          releases. We do not use this information for any purpose other than
          investigating and remedying the error.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          You always have the ability to control what information a Mobile App
          sends to us. You can exercise this control either by changing the
          settings of the Mobile App under its setting menu or changing the
          settings of your mobile device. Alternatively, you can remove the
          Mobile App from your mobile device entirely and access our services
          through our website.
